# Basic Functional Website (2022)

This project is a simple functional website I built in 2022 while learning the fundamentals of **HTML**, **CSS**, and beginner-level **JavaScript**.  
It doesn’t aim to be fancy — it was just my first hands-on step into web development, experimenting with how webpages are structured, styled, and made interactive.

## 🚀 Features
- Basic page layout with HTML  
- Styling using CSS (colors, typography, simple layouts)  
- Small interactive elements with JavaScript (buttons, alerts, etc.)  

## 🛠️ Methods & Technologies Used
- **HTML** → for structuring content  
- **CSS** → for styling, colors, and layout  
- **JavaScript (basics)** → for simple interactivity  
- **File-based development** (no frameworks, no build tools — just raw HTML/CSS/JS files in a browser)  

## 📅 Timeline
Built in **2022** as my first web project while learning the foundations of front-end development.
